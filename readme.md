My final project for Spiced Academy, a 12 week JavaScript-based web development course. Spotify API charts was completed in the last week of the course.

## Technology
**Data Viz:** D3.js (bubble chart),[Britecharts](https://github.com/eventbrite/britecharts), a D3 based library (bar charts)
**Frontend:** Handlebars
**Backend:** Express
**API:** [Spotify](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/)

## Description
The app connects to the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) using the Implicit Grant Authorization.

Once a user authorizes the app, they can view charts of their top tracks or favorite audio features, or search any track to view its unique audio features.
